{"name":"Minimal Status Bar for Safari","tagline":"a minimal (chrome-like) status bar for safari","body":"Minimal Status Bar (Safari extension)\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to provide a minimal (Google Chrome-like) status bar for\r\nSafari. It also has built-in longurl support to convert those pesky and opaque\r\nshort urls to long ones again.\r\n\r\nFile a [bug or feature request][1] and I'll try to get to it.\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n----------\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://cldup.com/_KsO06MxZt.png)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**[Download the extension][2]** and open it with Safari. Also, you'll probably want to hide the real status bar via View > Hide Status Bar (⌘/).\r\n\r\nPhilosophy\r\n----------\r\n\r\n - Looks just like it came with Safari.\r\n\r\n   People use Safari because they like how it works and looks. Keep to the same\r\n   promises. This means no themes, no customization other than what you\r\n   very likely already want. If you want customization, try [Ultimate Status\r\n   Bar][3].\r\n\r\n - Useful\r\n\r\n   If you're here, it's because you want a useful status bar. Shorturl\r\n   lengthening and other info is appreciated, but should balance\r\n   intrusiveness.\r\n\r\n - Latest\r\n\r\n   This will follow the latest versions of Safari, meaning if Safari changes\r\n   look and feel, this will match only the latest. You might try [previous revisions][4]\r\n   if you're trying to match older Safari versions.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\n - Visnu Pitiyanuvath ([visnup])\r\n - Zak Johnson ([zakj])\r\n - Michael Bailey ([mb3])\r\n - Bjørn Rostad ([bearroast])\r\n - Mike Fitzgerald ([fitzymj])\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar/issues\r\n[2]: https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar/releases/download/v1.13/Minimal-Status-Bar-1.13.safariextz\r\n[3]: http://ultimatestatusbar.com/\r\n[4]: https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar/releases\r\n[visnup]: https://github.com/visnup\r\n[zakj]: https://github.com/zakj\r\n[mb3]: https://github.com/mb3\r\n[bearroast]: https://github.com/bearroast\r\n[fitzymj]: https://github.com/fitzymj\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
