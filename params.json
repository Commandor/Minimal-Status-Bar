{"body":"# Minimal Status Bar (Safari extension)\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to provide a minimal (Google Chrome-like) status bar for\r\nSafari. It also has built-in longurl support to convert those pesky and opaque\r\nshort urls to long ones again.\r\n\r\nFile a [bug or feature request][1] and I'll try to get to it.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://f.cl.ly/items/0J2y0o2l2F3X2E1H3E3G/status%20bar.png)\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\n\r\n - Looks just like it came with Safari.\r\n\r\n   People use Safari because they like how it works and looks. Keep to the same\r\n   promises. This means no themes, no customization other than what you\r\n   very likely already want. If you want customization, try [Ultimate Status\r\n   Bar][2].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar/issues\r\n[2]: http://ultimatestatusbar.com/\r\n","tagline":"a minimal (chrome-like) status bar for safari","note":"Don't delete this file!
