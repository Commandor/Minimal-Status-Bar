# Minimal Status Bar (Safari extension)

This is an extension to provide a minimal (Google Chrome-like) status bar for
Safari. It also has built-in longurl support to convert those pesky and opaque
short urls to long ones again.

File a [bug or feature request][1] and I'll try to get to it.

## Philosophy

 - Looks just like it came with Safari.

   People use Safari because they like how it works and looks. Keep to the same
   promises. This means no themes, no customization other than what you
   very likely already want. If you want that, try [Ultimate Status Bar][2].
